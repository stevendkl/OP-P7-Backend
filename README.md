# OP-PROJECT7 #

This is the back end server for Project 7 of the Web Developer path.

### Back end Prerequisites ###

You will need to have `Node` and `MySQL` and `npm` installed locally on your machine.

### Back end Installation ###

Clone this repo. From the root folder of the project, run `npm install`.
Modify the `env.example` file and enter your information there, and rename it to `.env`.
You can then run the server with `nodemon server`. 
The schemas will be automatically created and visible in the database.

The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the
server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.
